# The PLACE X, Y, O
# will place the robot at position X, Y on the grid,
# with orientation O.
# Orientation are N, E, S, W (for North, East, South and West).
# Position (0,0) on the grid is the south west corner.
# First coordinate is along the East/West axis,
# the second coordinate is along the North/South axis.

# MOVE will move the robot one step forward,
# in whichever direction it is currently facing


# LEFT and RIGHT respectfully
# turn the robot 90Â° angle to the left or to the right.

# REPORT announces the position and orientation of the robot
# (X, Y, O) in any format (such as standard out)


# CONSTRAINTS:
# Commands are to be ignored until a valid PLACE command is issued
# Any commands that would put the robot out of the defined grid is to be ignored,
# all other commands (including another PLACE) are to be obeyed
